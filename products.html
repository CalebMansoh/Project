            Tomato plants are typically vines that can grow up to 3 meters (9.8 feet) tall but are often cultivated as shorter bush varieties. They have hairy stems and leaves that are pinnately compound, with leaflets that can be serrated. The flowers are yellow and bisexual, capable of self-fertilization, which is advantageous for cultivation since traditional pollinators may not always be present.
